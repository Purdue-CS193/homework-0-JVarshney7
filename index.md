**This is an Important Line<sup>TM</sup>**

_You can kiss a hundred boys in bars_  
_Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling_  
_You can say it's just the way you are_  
_Make a new excuse, another stupid reason_  
_Good **luck**, babe_

~~this song is totally not stuck in my head what are you talking about~~
